## Module 8 Overview
In Module Four, we studied how to perform hypothesis tests to test for
the difference of two population proportions and means. 

In this Module, the concept of hypothesis tesiting will be extended to three or more population means. 

### Zybooks Notes 8.1 One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA)

<dl>
  <dt> **One-way anaylsis of variance** <em>(one-way ANOVA)</em>
    <dd>-determines wheterh a statistically significant difference exists among the means of three or more populations <dd>

<ul>
  <li> **ANOVA** tests for an association between a categorcial predictor variable and a response variable </li>
  <li> A factor can be a continuous variable partitioned into intervals commonly referred to as bins </li>
  <li> An **ANOVA** test is used to compare the means of three or more populations; as the test determines an association exists between pridctor variable and response variable </li>
